RMark - Formula based interface for MARK
====================================================================

This package provides a formula based interface for MARK which does analysis
for a wide range of capture-recapture models. To use RMark, you need to install
[MARK](http://www.phidot.org/software/mark/).

You'll also want to read the [Gentle Introduction to MARK by Evan Cooch and Gary White](http://www.phidot.org/software/mark/docs/book/).

Beyond the help in the RMark package, additional documentation is in
Appendix C in [Cooch and White](http://www.phidot.org/software/mark/docs/book/). You can
find additional documentation [here](http://www.phidot.org/software/mark/rmark/RMarkDocumentation.zip).

The RMark package is available on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RMark/index.html) and you can download the 
CRAN version directly from R. I post a new version to CRAN about 6-10 times a year. I maintain the development version 
here. Click here to [download source zip](https://github.com/jlaake/RMark/archive/master.zip).

Download [Windows package binary](https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B77g1ScdUwVeOVJNUVVGS0YtWE0/edit). From link, browse to RMark and then click on
the version of the package you want. You should see a listing of the package contents as files.  Select File/Download. 
To install in R, from the R menu use Packages\Install from Local Zip file and browse to location of downloaded zip file.
